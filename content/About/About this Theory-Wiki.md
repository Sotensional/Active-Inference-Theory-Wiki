This Theory-Wiki ist the prototype of the idea that lead to my master-thesis: "Re-Entry of the system: Theory as a network". Herein I recompose the theory of Active Inference and  [[The Free-Energy Principle]], created by Karl Friston and many others. 
Browse the sentence folder to start. Good entries would be [[Systems exists]], [[Markov Blanket Condition]], or [[Sentences/Self-evidencing|Self-evidencing]]. 

The Theory-Wiki is split in three layers. The core layer are the sentences. Here the theory is decomposed into sentences, mostly highly formalized equations accompanied by explications. Those are connected with sentences that are influenced, or influence the sentence. E.g. related through mathematical derivations or by omission or additions of terms of by other transformations; necessary assumptions; inhibiting or elevating factors. The current graph view shows non-directed connections in uniform color. It is planed to set up a custom website that uses Juggl for the graph-view and thus supports custom connections. This would allow to differentiate different connections at a glance.

#### Terms
The Terms build a second layer of the network. [The active inference Ontology](https://coda.io/d/AII-Active-Inference-Ontology_djD38E5fJk_/Ontology-Full-Database_sulUryzy#Full-Active-Inference-Ontology_tuuOJ_Ew) is used as the dictionary. Each Term page links to the corresponding row in the 'Ontology'. Thus all changes to that project are always included. Downside is the perceptible delay in site instantiation that could break flow. The terms are there to clarify open questions and thus most likely only looked at in moments of slow thinking. 
As with the custom connections, the current graph view does not support filtering of nodes. The term notes should be hidden in the final graph and are only to clarify if needed. 

#### Community 
In the third layer the interaction and work is organized. Here changes, additions, restructurings are concerted. A changelog for major revisions and on a sentence basis are planed. 
Also: Tutorials, Intros, About Texts etc.
#### The hidden States
Behind the scenes. Templates, Tasks etc.
