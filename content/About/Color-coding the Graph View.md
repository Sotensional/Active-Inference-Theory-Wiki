In the graph view you could find 6 differently colored nodes, plus the uncolored grey nodes; ideally there would be only colored notes in the network.

The color-scheme should be accessible for color blind people and is by [Paul Tol](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/) and was found on [Davis Nichols](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind) site. The scheme has 8 colors thus two colors could still be used for later additions:  
<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="background-color:#117733"></td>
    <td>#117733</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="background-color:#AA4499"></td>
    <td>#AA4499</td>
</tr>
</table>

The typology of sentences used here was developed in my master thesis.
