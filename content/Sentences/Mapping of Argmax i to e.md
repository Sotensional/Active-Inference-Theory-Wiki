There is a mapping of the most likely [[Internal State|internal state]] to the most likely [[External State|external state]] given a [[Blanket State|blanket state]].
***
Definition of most likely internal and external states given a blanket state:
$$ e(b) = \text{argmax}_e \, p(e|b) $$
$$ i(b) = \text{argmax}_i \, p(i|b) $$
Definition of $\sigma$ to be the mapping that holds true to:
$$ e(b) = \sigma(i(b)) $$
