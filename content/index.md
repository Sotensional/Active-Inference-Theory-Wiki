title: Welcome to the Active Inference Theory Wiki
---
This Theory Wiki is the prototype of the idea I developed into my master thesis: "Re-Entry of the System: Theory as a Network" 

- [[The Theory-Wiki exists|Here]] first post about the beginning of the composition of the network.
- Under [[About this Theory-Wiki]] there is more on the project.
- The introduction of my thesis can be found in [[Wiedereintritt des Systems - Theorie als Netzwerk - Einleitung|German]] or in a [[Re-Entry of the System - Theory as Network - Introduction|English]] translation through word copilot

The core of the network is in the sentence folder. Good starting points should be [[Systems exists]] and [[Markov Blanket Condition]].
